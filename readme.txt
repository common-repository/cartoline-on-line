The easiest way to install and secure online postcards on your site, is the use of a program to upload or upload files on the server where the site is hosted, such as FileZilla, which you can easily search the name on any motor research.

1. First copy the folder "CartolineOL" in "plugin"

Once installed the program, you can transfer files as follows:

1. Open the program and access to the site with your username and password of the site, supplied from the hosting provider;
2. The window is made at the bottom, two sections where the files are listed, left those contained on your computer and right those contained in the root directory on the site server: select the file "CartolineOL.zip" from the folder where you have previously downloaded and extract it (right click, and select the menu item "Extract All ..." and then leave unchanged and press "Extract" at the bottom, the files will be extracted in the same folder as informed zip);
3. From the right side, navigate to reach the folder / htdocs / wp-content / plugins / and drag, keeping you down on the left mouse button, the extracted files.
